Welcome to the IMDb Score Prediction Project! This project aims to predict IMDb movie scores using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The IMDb Score Prediction Project is developed to analyze and predict movie scores on IMDb. We utilize various machine learning algorithms and techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate a movie's IMDb score based on its features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the data analysis and machine learning pipeline.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models for IMDb score prediction.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for the project.

## How to Use

1. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and model training process.
2. To use the IMDb score prediction model in your own application, refer to the example code in the `src/` directory.



Happy coding! ðŸš€
